## About me

---

I've always been interested in how cloud applications, websites, games, and design are created, and I've always wanted to be a part of it. A couple of months ago I went through several intensive courses and understood how websites work, it inspired me. I consider creating cool things to be part of creativity. The more I learn about working in front-end development, the more I want to do it. With my natural curiosity and meticulousness, I will always move on in such an interesting direction.
